# Card Tiles
Allows you to Drag-n-Drop Cards from you Card Collections onto the game board and automatically create a tile that represents the card. The card face can be iterated by clicking on it (requires [Monk's Active Tile Triggers](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-active-tiles)).

## Todos
* Map a card 1-to-1 with its Tile representation (for recalling cards to decks).
* Avoid blocking the board drag-n-drop listener for the purpose of this module.
* Remove dependency from Monk's plugin (no hard feelings, but less dependencies the better).

## Changelog
### v0.0.2
Fixed tile size being incorrect even when card size is set.

### v0.0.1
Initial release with bare minimum support.
